# Introduction

For this project, we will train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.

Trained Agent

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. 
Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects 
around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. 

Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

- 0 - move forward.
- 1 - move backward.
- 2 - turn left.
- 3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, your agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

Unity Machine Learning Agents (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents.

For game developers, these trained agents can be used for multiple purposes, including controlling NPC behavior (in a variety of settings such as multi-agent and adversarial), automated testing of game builds and evaluating different game design decisions pre-release.

In this course, you will use Unity's rich environments to design, train, and evaluate your own deep reinforcement learning algorithms. You can read more about ML-Agents by perusing the GitHub repository.
